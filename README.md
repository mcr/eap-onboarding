# EAP-Onboarding -- an unauthenticated client mode for EAP-TLS

This document describes a method by which an unconfigured device can
use EAP-TLS to join a network on which further device onboarding, network
attestation or other remediation can be done.
While RFC 5216 supports EAP-TLS without a client certificate, that document defines no method by which unauthenticated EAP-TLS can be used.
This draft addresses that issue.
